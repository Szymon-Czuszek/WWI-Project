# Project Overview

## Description

This project aims to create a comprehensive data analysis system based on the Wide World Importers (WWI) database. The system integrates SQL, SAS, and Python to manage, analyze, and visualize customer transaction data. By leveraging the strengths of each technology, the project provides a robust solution for handling large datasets, performing complex statistical analyses, and generating insightful reports.
